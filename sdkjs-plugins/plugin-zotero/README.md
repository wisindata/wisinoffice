# ONLYOFFICE Zotero plugin

Zotero plugin allows users to create bibliographies in ONLYOFFICE editors using Zotero service.

The plugin is pre-installed in ONLYOFFICE Workspace (both Enterprise and Community Edition), ONLYOFFICE cloud service, and ONLYOFFICE Personal. It can also be installed to Document Server and desktop editors manually. 

## How to use

1. Search references by author, title or year.

2. Among search results, choose ones you want to add to your document.

3. Choose style (e.g. Chicago Manual, American Psychological Association) and language.

4. Press `Insert citation`.

Please note that Zotero works only with user’s personal library associated with the your account. The desired sources must be added to your library in Zotero before you can search and add them to your bibliography via plugin.

## How to install to server

Two installation ways are available:

1. Put the folder with the plugin code to ONLYOFFICE Document Server folder depending on the operating system:

    For Linux - `/var/www/onlyoffice/documentserver/sdkjs-plugins/`.

    For Windows - `%ProgramFiles%\ONLYOFFICE\DocumentServer\sdkjs-plugins\`.

    The plugins will be available to all the users users of ONLYOFFICE Document Server.
    No service restart is required.

2. Edit the Document Server config to add the following lines:

    ```
    var docEditor = new DocsAPI.DocEditor("placeholder", {
        "editorConfig": {
            "plugins": {
                "autostart": [
                    "asc.{BFC5D5C6-89DE-4168-9565-ABD8D1E48711}",
                    ...
                ],
                "pluginsData": [
                    "https://example.com/path/to/zotero/config.json",
                    ...
                ]
            },
            ...
        },
        ...
    });
    ```
**Important**: when you integrate ONLYOFFICE Document Server with a 3rd-party storage, you need to use special connectors (integration apps). If you compile a connector from source code or create a new one, you can add plugins using Document Server config. If you use ready connectors (e.g. from ownCloud/Nextcloud marketplaces) adding plugins via config is not applicable.

## How to install to desktop

* Archive the plugin files (the archive must contain config.json, index.html, and pluginCode.js).
* Change the file extension to .plugin.
* Go to the Plugins tab, click Manage Plugins >> Add plugin, browse for the .plugin file.

## Known issues

For CentOS users with SELinx enabled, after copying the src folder to sdkjs-plugins, plugins may not work due to the variable file security context. To restore the rights, use the following command:

```
sudo restorecon -Rv /var/www/onlyoffice/documentserver/sdkjs-plugins/
```

After that restart the services:

```
sudo supervisorctl restart ds:docservice
```
